**Decoding Democracy and Development using Codes: A Data Analytics View of the Influence of Specific Variables of Democracy on Selected Variables of Social Development**

This project was undertaken as my capstone project in my data analytics bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin. 
The Project seeks to use data analytic tools to fill the research gaps in overgeneralization of the concept of democracy which is often considered as a unit measured interms of democracy index by exposing the impact of specific variables of democracy and their influence of specific variables of social development. 

In the EDA files, you will find the data used (source), the data frame (rows and columns), explanations as to the justifications of the project, its limitations and intended importance. 

The analysis presents the spread of democracy globally, categorised into Weak, Moderate and Strong democracies. It also shows the social development indices of various countries and the relationship between each of the democratic variables and social development.
